Hi, welcome to contact me. I take on some small projects in my spare time. If you have any development needs, feel free to reach out!

Relatively speaking, I have a wide range of technical skills, but I'm not an expert in any particular field. Among all the technologies, my strongest expertise lies in front-end development, followed by small-scale back-end development using Golang.

#### My technology stack includes:

- Front-end: Typescript, Vue, JavaScript, Tailwindcss, Electron, Vite
- Back-end: Golang-Gin, PHP-Laravel, Node, MongoDB, MySQL
- Mobile: Ionic, PWA
- DevOps: Docker, K8S, Linux, Kvm, Nginx
- Other languages: Python, C/C++, C#

#### Projects I can do:

- Full-stack web applications (with separate front-end and back-end), custom website development
- Various cross-platform applications (PC and mobile)
- Browser scripts (custom functions, data scraping, automation)
- Web scraping, data collection, and processing
- Various small tools
- Browser extensions
- ... any programming-implementable requirements

I provide free bug fixes within a year. All programs are maintainable and iterative, rather than one-time solutions.

#### Pricing

Since I take on small projects mainly to practice my skills, my rates are not high. Pricing will be based on the specific difficulty and projected time required, roughly between 짜300 - 짜500 per day. For some small tools/scripts, it can range from 짜100 - 짜400.

#### What kind of projects am I suitable for?

In order to better understand various technologies, I prefer to work on applications that require a broad range of skills. This is also my primary way of learning programming. I would rather familiarize myself with the application and essence of various technologies through practical development practices.

If you are an individual, I can help you automate repetitive tasks, freeing up more time for your creative endeavors.

If you are a company, I can assist you in completing projects in areas unfamiliar to you, exploring new directions at a lower cost.
