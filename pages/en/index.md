Hi, I'm wearzdk, a full-stack developer currently studying programming as a college student.

I wouldn't call myself an open source enthusiast, but I do open source some of the small things I create, such as practical tools, project templates, technology sharing, or libraries that haven't been done before.

On this website, I occasionally publish technical articles as a form of blogging. I also write some casual notes about the pitfalls I encounter.

I've tried setting up several blog sites before, but most of them didn't last. On one hand, I felt my skills weren't sufficient and I was afraid of misleading others. On the other hand, the customization and styling options of the blogging systems were poor and didn't match my preferences, which made it difficult to stay motivated. This website is based on [antfu.me](https://github.com/antfu/antfu.me) with modifications and uses the technology stack I currently favor. It can be customized through code. Many thanks to antfu and the selfless contributions of developers in the Vue ecosystem. If you like this blogging system, you can also fork it to your own repository for personalized customization.

Additionally, I'm also looking for job opportunities. If you have any project requirements, feel free to contact me for development. I can independently complete most small and medium-sized website projects, as well as tasks like web scraping, scripting, browser extensions, and JavaScript reverse engineering. For more details, please check [Hire Me](./hire).

Furthermore, I'm seeking internship opportunities as well. If you're an HR professional, please take a look at my [Resume](./resume).
